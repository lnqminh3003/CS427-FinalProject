### Introduction
The global community has experienced the far-reaching effects of the Covid-19 pandemic, which compelled us to adopt remote work arrangements and, in turn, deprived us of essential social interactions. Within this context, the gaming industry has capitalized on the opportunity to facilitate connections between individuals during lockdowns.

They've established virtual metaverses where individuals from across the globe can converge, host virtual events, embark on virtual journeys, and personalize their avatars to reflect their unique personalities and styles. Among these remarkable features, our focus is on integrating a segment of their concepts. We aim to foster an environment where people can relax together, extending beyond gaming, while also introducing enhanced communication and collaboration methods.

### Idea:
Accessible on personal computers, which connects people from around the world, enabling them to engage in conversations and play games together. Similarly, another game are the option that has gained popularity among the Vietnamese population in recent months. This game primarily focuses on group gatherings and entertainment, providing a virtual space for everyone to enjoy together.

These games have captured the attention of numerous young enthusiasts owing to their vibrant and entertaining nature. We aspire to replicate a similar experience while considering a senior audience. Although older individuals also maintain social connections, they may not dedicate as much time to video gaming.

### How to play?
Upon entering the game, you'll be prompted to choose an in-game name. Once that's done, the gaming world opens up to you.

You have the option to either create your own room or join a pre-existing one that your friends have set up using Photon technology. Stepping into the Lobby room provides an interactive hub where you can engage with your friends through both text and voice chat. But that's not all – our game offers a plethora of additional features to enhance your gaming experience.

One of the most exciting features is the ability to jump into other games hosted within the Lobby room, such as the heart-pounding **Survival game**. This mode challenges you and your friends to work together to achieve victory.

In the **Survival game**, your mission is to gather all the randomly scattered energy bottles across the in-game playground. This is a race against time, as you'll also need to evade the menacing gaze of two relentless monsters. Speed is of the essence as you dash to collect energy, all while encouraging and motivating your friends to join you in the winner's circle.

Let's delve deeper into the details and strategies for this thrilling game mode – there's so much more to explore and experience!
